V2. Analysis Button Behavior
-After the scan completes,  “Analyze” button should be there instead of existing button
-On click:
    Navigate to a new page (do NOT replace content on the same page).
**USING OUTPUT JSON FROM GEMINI**
3. Projects Listing Page
-Display the 3 projects as stacked widgets/cards, ordered:
    Easy
    Medium
    Hard
-Each widget should show:
    Project title
    Difficulty badge (color-coded)
    Short description
-UI must be mobile-first, clean spacing, large tap targets.

4. Project Details Page
-Clicking a project widget opens a new page.
-Display the 5 steps clearly using:
-Numbered step cards or timeline UI
-Clear hierarchy (step number → step text)
-Ensure smooth navigation (back button support).

5. UI & UX Constraints
-Mobile-first layout (no desktop-only assumptions).
-Minimalist design, no clutter.
-Fast transitions, clear visual hierarchy.

6. Technical Notes
-Keep data flow clean between pages.
-Assume JSON from Gemini is the single source of truth.
-Do not invent extra projects or steps beyond the JSON.
